# Creative-computing

I have had contact with Arduino-related work. So I've always been interested in Arduino. But I thought it would be very difficult for me, so I never tried to experiment with Arduino on my own. But this course has allowed me to try it out.

At first we tried to wire up an LED in class and although the LED didn't quite work out in the end we got to know the Arduino a little better in the process.

After the class
I came up with a lot of ideas related to Creative Computing.
Ultimately I wanted to use Arduino to create a device that could sense people's emotions.
Because in life people tend to hide their emotions and many negative emotions can be depressing. But if people can wear a device that can sense their emotions, it can let people around them know what kind of emotions they are feeling at the moment. Do they need help?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started by simulating an Arduino sensor in TINKERCAD that would make the LEDs light up when they touched a specified area. So I thought that different colored LEDs would light up when people had different emotions arising.

For example  ：

Happy: yellow

Sad: blue

Angry: red

(There are many ways to wear the device, I'm just giving an example to prove it)

After this, I worked on the Arduino sound sensor. and made it. It can be used to make LEDs light up through sound. The process was a bit complicated and we tried many times. But the end result was good. We managed to get the LEDs to light up with sound.

I think such an Arduino sound sensor could be combined with many artworks. More interesting results could be achieved. For example some interesting sound interaction devices. Or some touch interaction devices. It's all very interesting.

Creative Computing has given me an insight into Arduino and has shown me what more interesting ways of creating can be used in future designs.
I think there will be more interesting inspirations and ways of making things if I study further.
